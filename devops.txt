previously it was not tht much easy to release or deliver a software..
developers want freedom to innovate and operations teams want
to mitigate risk.together development and operations are tasked
with building and releasing software fast,pretictably,with high quality,securely,efficiently and more.for them.devops is the promised land


Using DevOps tools like puppet,chef and jenkins to automate
specific development taks is only the first step in a DevOps approach.Each tool solves distinct point problems.But not any one manages and automates the entire software delivery process.


An enterprise Devops approach calls for a framework to organize and control your software delivery pipeline
